                                Ron DeSantis is the former U.S. Representative for Floridaâ€™s Sixth District and is currently serving as the 46th governor of Florida. 
                                
                                A native Floridian with blue-collar roots, Ron DeSantis worked his way through Yale University, where he graduated with honors and was the captain of the varsity baseball team. He also graduated with honors from Harvard Law School. While at Harvard, he earned a commission in the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer. After active-duty service, DeSantis served as a federal prosecutor, where he targeted and convicted child predators.  He was first elected to Congress in 2012, where he fought for term limits, the No Budget/No Pay Act, and to cut taxes.  While serving in Congress, Ron refused his Congressional pension and health insurance plan because he is against special deals for politicians.
